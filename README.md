# ouseful-ai-magics

Simple IPython magics for experimenting with locally run generative AI text and image models.

Magics built around third party Python packages offering Python APIs to generative models:

- [`llm`](https://github.com/simonw/llm): command line and Python API for text models
- [`sdkit`](https://github.com/easydiffusion/sdkit): Pyhton API for Locally run Stable Diffusion
